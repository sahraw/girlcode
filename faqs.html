        <h3>WHAT IS CODING?</h3>
        <p> Put simply, a programming (or coding) language is a set of syntax rules that define how code should be written and formatted. Thousands of different programming languages make it possible for us to create computer software, apps and websites.</p></div></div>
        <div class="boxed">
          <div class="faq-page">
            <h3>WHY IS IT IMPORTANT?</h3>
            <p>Without coding, computers would do nothing.That’s because source code is the set of instructions that tells the computer what to do. Computers have no free will, after all, so without explicit instruction, they’re just sophisticated hunks of metal. Without coding we wouldn't have the apps, websites or even the internet that we enjoy today.</p></div></div>

                <h3> IS CODING HARD TO LEARN?</h3>
                <p>Nothing worth learning ever comes easy! It takes a lot of practice and trial and error to master coding techniques. Practice makes perfect!</p></div></div>

                  <div class="faq-page">
                    <h3>HOW WILL LEARNING IT BE USEFUL TO ME?</h3>
                    <p>Having some knowlegde of programming languages can go a very long way. It can help you understand the ins and outs of computers which could be very useful as both a personal skill and for any future employment.</p></div></div>

                        <h3>I'VE NOTICED YOUR PAGE FOCUSES ON GIRLS AND CODING. WHY IS THAT?</h3>
                        <p>Our aim is to create a safe space where women of all backgrounds feel inspired and connected to other female coders around the world. We want to get more women to understand more about the coding as it has been a male dominated profession for some time.</p></div></div>
