      <h2> Sahra </h2>
      <p> “My name is Sahra and I’m in my second year of my undergraduate degree. I chose to do Code First: Girls because it was so wildly different from anything I have ever learned before. I heard about the course through a friend and signed up. After this course I hope to use my new coding skills and learn how to create more web pages."</p>
