    <h1>Woman of the Week</h1>
    <h2>We honour a Woman each week and celebrate their contributions to the field of Technology.</h2>

    <h3><b>Woman of the Week</b>  <em>Grace Hopper</em></h3>

    <div class= "background-text">
      <p>Grace was a pioneering computer scientist best known for creating the first computing language, Common Business Orientated Language (COBOL).
        Grace developed this programming language to resemble the English language, so it would be easy to read and write.
        Such were her achievements that in 1969 she was named “Computer Science Man of the Year” by the Data Processing Management Association, and in 1991 she was awarded the National Medal of Technology at age 85.</p>

      <h3><b>Woman of the Week</b>  <em>Hedy Lamarr</em></h3>
      <img class="img-responsive">
      <img class="img-circle" src="images/hedylamarr.jpg" style="width:100%">
      <div class= "background-text">
        <p>Born in 1914 in Austria, Hedy found early success on the silver screen. Legend has it she became bored with the glamorous but unchallenging film roles she was offered, and so turned to invention as a distraction. She went on to patent a new frequency-hopping, spread-spectrum technology. This design fostered communication technology that we use every day, such as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.</p>

      <h3><b>Woman of the Week</b>  <em>Katherine Johnsonn</em></h3>
      <img class="img-responsive">
      <img class="img-circle" src="images/katherinejohnson.jpg" style="width:100%">
      <div class="background-text">
        <p>Katherine Johnson overcame incredible odds and played an integral part in launching the first man into space to orbit the Earth.
          Working as a human computer, she calculated the mathematical data required to launch NASA’s first successful space missions, such as trajectories and wind tunnel test results.
          Breaking through barriers on a daily basis, she completed calculations that the technology of the time could not.</p>
